just an attempt of following the tutorial to learn ansible, and at the same time procure a quick way of creating a work environment

This is part of a bigger effort, to have a remote work station, with some basics, fully automated.

1- something to provision a machine in AWS

2- something to run the ansible playbook as downloaded from the branch master of a repo

3- mount something like a filesystem with access to a cloud (dropbox, drive, whatever)

and give you the access details of such a thing. 

## Improvements

- do all that using authenticated repos and not public ones?

- maybe one day include the local workstation as well?
